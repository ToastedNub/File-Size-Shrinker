 - HOW IT WORKS

All it does is shrink the size of a file as much as possible without decreasing video quality by a noticable amount (it looks almost the same after put through the script)

 - HOW TO USE

Put your files (Images, Videos, Gifs) into the "FILES" folder

Run the "Start" file

When the console closes, your shrunk files will be in the "OUTPUT" folder
